This document presents Master Plan 4, a comprehensive framework for establishing a sustainable multiplanetary civilization through the strategic deployment of interplanetary artificial intelligence. The plan outlines the technological, organizational, and ethical foundations required to extend human presence beyond Earth in a way that is both sustainable and scalable.

Key components of the plan include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Autonomous resource utilization systems
    \item Self-sustaining habitat technologies
    \item AI-driven ecosystem management
    \item Interplanetary communication networks
    \item Ethical frameworks for AI in space
\end{itemize}

By leveraging recent advancements in artificial intelligence, robotics, and space technology, Master Plan 4 provides a realistic roadmap for achieving a permanent human presence on multiple celestial bodies within our solar system.
